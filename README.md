# **15-418 Project**
15-418 Final Research Project on Parallel Matrix Inversion 
<br><br>

## **Title** 
---
### **Parallel Matrix Inversion**
by Allen Xie and Chi Nguyen
<br><br>

## **Summary**
---
The goal of this project is to parallelize various implementaitons of inversing a matrix and analyze their performance trade-offs. There are two approaches of interest we will specifically focus on: matrix inversion through LU Decomposition and Gauss-Jordan Elimination.
